### Project details
***************************
This project uses the Tennis environment and RLdeep learning based models for multi-agent continuous controls and actions to solve the question. 

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. However, if a ball hits the ground or the ball is out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The environment is considered solved when the agent reaches average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). 

### Getting started
***************************
1. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) to install Unity ML-Agents.

2. Download the environment from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
