### Project details
***************************
This project uses the Tennis environment and RLdeep learning based models for multi-agent continuous controls and actions to solve the question. 

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. However, if a ball hits the ground or the ball is out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The environment is considered solved when the agent reaches average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). 

### Getting started
***************************

The project uses Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions in `Tennis.ipynb` to get started with training your own agent!
